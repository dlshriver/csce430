Task 1:
	Part 2:
		1. Rotate instructions will preserve the one when moving through because it would
			come back around where as shift (if it reached LEDR0 for instance) would shift that 
			one and turn it into a 0 not preserving the 1 that was initially there where the LED was lit.
		2. We simply set up a check for such a case. The way I handled it was if the LED's value I was on was greater than one
			I branched to the normal case of setting the value as if nothing was wrong but if we didn't come to this branch
			we set the value to be the value of LEDR9 and then executed the rest of the code.
		3. You could make a counter and whenever we hit LEDR0, we then shut it off and make sure to set LEDR9 to 1 (if we shift right that is).
