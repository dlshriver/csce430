1. The software files can be found in Assembler. This folder has our implementation of an assembler to create mif files. It is writen in Java. An example assembly file and mif file can be found in Assembler/Assembler/data.
2. The processor design and hardware files can be found in project_pipelined/. This folder contains all of our hardware files.
3. The Quartus project file can be found in project_pipelined/. It is named project.qpf.
4. The mif files can be found in project_pipelined/. The mif for instructions is named instr.mif, and for data it is called memoryinitialization.mif. We also have all the test cases in separate mifs named: testCase1.mif, testCase2.mif, testCase3.mif, and testCase4.mif. To use one of these, simply copy the contents into memoryinitialization.mif.
